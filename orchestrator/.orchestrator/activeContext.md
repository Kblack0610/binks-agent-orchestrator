- Verdict: PENDING

## Latest Plan Summary
Based on the context provided, this is a simple "Hello World" task. Let me design a straightforward solution.

## Solution Design: "Hello World"

### Overview

The goal is to implement a simple "Hello World" program. Given this is within the `binks-agent-orchestrator` project context, I'll design a minimal solution that fits the existing project structure.

### Architecture Decision

For a "Hello World" requirement, there are several approaches:

| Option | Description | Complexity |
|-----...

## Latest Implementation Summary
It seems I need permission to write files. Could you grant write access so I can create the `hello.py` file?...

## Latest Review
I'd be happy to review an implementation, but I don't see any code or implementation provided in your message. You mentioned a `hello.py` file, but no code was shared.

Could you please provide:
1. The code/implementation you want me to review
2. The original task requirements or specification

Once you share these, I'll evaluate the architecture, design patterns, correctness, and completeness, then provide a clear verdict....

## Next Steps
Fix issues and iterate
