# Agent Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .agent.toml and customize as needed
#
# Configuration priority:
#   1. CLI arguments (--model, --ollama-url)
#   2. Environment variables (OLLAMA_MODEL, OLLAMA_URL)
#   3. This config file (.agent.toml)
#   4. Hardcoded defaults
#
# The agent searches for .agent.toml starting from the current directory
# and walking up the directory tree (like .mcp.json)

[llm]
# Ollama server URL
url = "http://localhost:11434"

# Model to use (qwen2.5-coder:32b recommended for Mac Studio with M3 Ultra)
model = "qwen2.5-coder:32b"

[agent]
# Optional system prompt for the agent
# system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant with access to system tools."

[monitor]
# Polling interval in seconds for the monitor command
interval = 300

# Repositories to monitor (can also be passed via --repos)
repos = [
    # "owner/repo1",
    # "owner/repo2",
]
