## Current State
- Status: ITERATION 1
- Phase: REVIEWING (just completed)
- Verdict: FAIL

## Latest Plan Summary
Looking at this task, it's extremely simple - just write `print('hi')`. Let me provide a quick architectural assessment.

## Solution Design

### Task Analysis
The request is to write a single line of Python code: `print('hi')`

### Design Decision

This is a trivial task that requires no architectural design. The implementation is self-contained with:
- **No components** - single statement
- **No dependencies** - uses Python built-in
- **No integration points** - standalone execution
- **No sca...

## Latest Implementation Summary
I need permission to write the file. Please grant write access to create the `hi.py` file....

## Latest Review
I don't see any implementation to review. You mentioned a `hi.py` file, but I don't have access to its contents or know what task it's supposed to accomplish.

Could you please:
1. Share the code you'd like me to review
2. Describe what the code is supposed to do

Once you provide the implementation and its requirements, I'll be able to give you a thorough review with a verdict.

VERDICT: FAIL...

## Next Steps
Fix issues and iterate
